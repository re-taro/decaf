    This study focuses on implementing a TypeScript checker to ensure soundness in the context of gradual typing.
    It evaluates the existing TypeScript type system against the criteria for gradual typing, highlighting its deficiencies in guaranteeing soundness due to the lack of runtime type checks.
    A novel tool, decaf, was developed to address these issues by extending the TypeScript type system with static analysis capabilities, enabling the detection of type inconsistencies at compile time.
    Experimental results demonstrate that while decaf enforces a more rigorous type system compared to the TypeScript Compiler (TSC), it shows trade-offs in performance, particularly for large-scale codebases.
    Future improvements are suggested to enhance decaf's compatibility and performance, paving the way for safer TypeScript programming without runtime overheads.
