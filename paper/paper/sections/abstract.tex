    In the context of large-scale software development, maintaining code quality and development speed is crucial.
    TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, incorporates static typing to address these challenges, utilizing a gradual typing system.
    However, its type system has limitations in terms of soundness.
    This study aims to evaluate TypeScript's compliance with gradual typing criteria and develop a new type checker, "decaf," which ensures soundness in static typing.
    Implemented in Rust, decaf employs a stricter type system than the standard TypeScript compiler (tsc).
    Experiments reveal that decaf provides enhanced static analysis, detecting potential runtime errors at compile time.
    While decaf demonstrates slower performance on larger programs due to its comprehensive checks, it achieves faster results on standard-sized cases, indicating its practicality for improving TypeScript's reliability without compromising usability.
